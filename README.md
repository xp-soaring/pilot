# X-Plane pilot models

This is a mod to an existing pilot model.

Available with and without headphones, the entire seat strap, or without just the lower
part of the seat strap which tends to poke out the side of some aircraft (i.e. gliders).

## Usage

Add this 'pilot' director to an 'objects' folder in your aircraft folder.

Using Plane Maker, add the chosen pilot model (e.g. pilot.obj) as the FIRST object
in 'Misc Objects'.

Suggested starting positioning is: 1.25, 0.85, 1.25 with a heading of 1 and a pitch of 29.
